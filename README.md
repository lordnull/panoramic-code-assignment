# Micah Warren's Purescript Assignment

Thank you for taking the time to look over my code and resume. It's actually
been fun working in purescript.

The data model assignment is in the 'data-model' and the dog api is in 'web-app'.

The web-app has two components, the server and app. Both will be built when using make.

Running the server is as simple as 'node output/Server.js'. Browsing to 'http://localhost:8080'
should bring the web-app up.
